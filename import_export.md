--> We can export functions, that functions we can access by using path.

--> syntax :
Export --> export add = (x, y) => x + y;
Import --> import {add} from 'path'

--> Possibilities :
We can export functions.
We can pass arrays, we can modify also.
We can pass values but we can't modify that values.
